                   1988, in Delhi, India, Kohli showed early promise in cricket and

               <h3>IPL Career</h3>
               <br>
               <p>
                   Virat Kohli has played for the Royal Challengers Bangalore throughout his IPL career and is the only player to have played for just one franchise in IPL history. His first two seasons for RCB did not yield much in the way of runs, but he had some standout performances after his promotion to vice captain in 2010. Ahead of the 2011 IPL auctions, teams were mandated by league officials to retain up to four players each. Kohli was the only player RCB retained, for $1.8 million. He played some key knocks (innings) as RCB reached the league final but lost to Chennai Super Kings that year.
